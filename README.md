## Introduction
This repository is a SvelteKit starter project integrating BabylonJS to demonstrate a basic 3D scene. It's designed to guide developers through using BabylonJS within a Svelte application.

## Why Svelte?
Svelte is an innovative approach to building web interfaces, offering a cleaner, more concise, and modern alternative to ReactJS. It compiles your code to minimal JavaScript at build time, ensuring better performance and a more enjoyable developer experience.
>The small bundle size is a big deal when designing for the web, either for SEO reasons or simple to be able to ship a larger game/app.
With Svelte, you write less code, thanks to its elimination of hooks and complex state management.

## Why BabylonJS?
BabylonJS is a full-fledged 3D engine, offering a comprehensive feature set for game development and immersive experiences. It includes built-in physics and animation engines for realistic interactions and movements. BabylonJS's performance and advanced capabilities make it the ideal choice for sophisticated 3D web applications.
